- **Gradual Feature Migration**: Too slow, extends timeline unnecessarily

### Implementation Timeline
```
Month 1: Phase 1 - Foundation (IPC + File System)
Month 2: Phase 2 - Architecture (Windows + Dialogs)  
Month 3: Phase 3 - Integration (Fonts + Menus + Platform)
Month 4: Phase 4 - Launch (PWA + Testing + Production)
```
